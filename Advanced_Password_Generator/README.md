# 🔐 Advanced Password Generator (Python GUI)

An advanced **Python-based password generator** with a modern **Tkinter GUI** that allows users to generate **secure, customizable passwords** using cryptographically safe randomness.

This project is designed for **students, beginners transitioning to intermediate level**, and anyone learning **GUI development + security basics in Python**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This application generates strong random passwords based on **user-defined rules**, including:

- Password length
- Character types (letters, numbers, symbols)
- Exclusion of specific characters
- Real-time password strength evaluation
- One-click clipboard copying

The project follows **secure password generation principles** using Python’s `secrets` module instead of insecure random generators.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

- Secure random generation (`secrets` module)
- Character set management
- User input validation
- Password strength evaluation
- GUI development using Tkinter
- Clipboard integration
- Basic UI/UX design principles

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Graphical User Interface (GUI)

## 🛡️ Password Strength Logic

Password strength is calculated based on:

- Length (≥8, ≥12)
- Presence of:
  - Letters
  - Numbers
  - Symbols

The strength is displayed with **color indicators** for better user feedback.
